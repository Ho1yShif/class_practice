# class_practice
Hi everyone,

This respository is a space for me to practice programming. At the time I created this, I had just started diving deeper into classes, so I called it 'class_practice'.

In this repo, you'll find:
- Problems from LinkedIn Learning courses
- LeetCode problems
- Mini-projects

Thanks for taking the time to check this out :)
