# class_practice
Hi everyone,

I created this respository as a space for me to practice utilizing advanced programming. At the time I created this, I had just started diving deeper into classes, so I called it 'class_practice'.

In this repo, you'll find:
- Personal projects
- LinkedIn Learning problems
- LeetCode and StrataScratch problems

Thanks for taking the time to check this out :)
